# About Six Degrees of Nooj

Q: Who made this website?   
A: [Li-Wen Yip](https://www.facebook.com/liwen.yip) wrote the code. [Sam Hubbard](http://www.barbershopwiki.com/wiki/Sam_Hubbard) compiled the original source data set (thanks Sam!)

Q: Why is it named after Nooj?   
A: ~~Because everyone knows he's BABS' best baritone~~ I couldn't think of any other Mononymous barbershoppers in BABS.

Q: Why are there some links missing when I select "Show me x degrees of x"?   
A: Because it's only showing the closest links to each person. If it included ALL links then it would look very messy and have no hope of layout out nicely.

Q: Why doesn't it work properly on my computer/tablet/phone?   
A: Because I'm not a very good web programmer and I've probably used some ECMAScript feature that's not well supported across all browsers.

Q: Can I get a copy of the source data?   
A: Yes - download from [github](https://github.com/liwenyip/6-degrees-of-nooj/blob/gh-pages/BABS%20Quartet%20Singers.csv)

Q: Can I make corrections or contributions to the source data?   
A: Sure, create yourself a github account and then you can make edits to the [source data file](https://github.com/liwenyip/6-degrees-of-nooj/blob/gh-pages/BABS%20Quartet%20Singers.csv).

Q: Why doesn't the source data include LABBS/SAI/mixed quartets, or quartets from other countries?   
A: Someone get me the data, or see above re contributing via github.

Q: Why is the web design so ugly?   
A: Because I couldn't be bothered making it look pretty.

Q: Can I help add more features or make the website look more sexy?   
A: Sure, see above re contributing via github.
